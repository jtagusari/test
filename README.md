# H-RISK with NoiseModelling

## About

This is a QGIS plugin, which implements NoiseModelling (https://github.com/Universite-Gustave-Eiffel/NoiseModelling) and help estimate the health risks posed by (road traffic) noise.

## Features

This plugin can

- fetch geometries from OpenStreetMap, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and Vector Tiles (provided by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan).
- predict sound levels using NoiseModelling, by executing the Java script (specified Java implementation is required).
- estimate health risks based on the predicted sound levels and expore-response relationships shown in the Environmental Noise Guidelines in European Region (WHO Regional Office for Europe).

At this moment, the operation of the plugin with NoiseModelling v4.0.2 is confirmed. (Not with v4.0.4)

## How to use

### Fetch the geometries

The user can fetch the geometries of roads and buildings using algorithms in `Fetch geometries` group.
In Japan, precised data (including population) can be obtained using algorithms in `Fetch geometries (Ja)` group.

The algorithms are:

- `Fetch geometries` group
  - Road centerline (OSM) (`fetchosmroad.py`): fetch road geometries from OpenStreetMap. `QuickOSM` is needed.
  - Building (OSM) (`fetchosmbuilding.py`): fetch building geometries from OpenStreetMap. `QuickOSM` is needed.
  - Elevation points (SRTM) (`fetchsrtmdem.py`): fetch elevation-points geometries from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission dataset. User id and password of Earthdata Login (https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new) is needed.
- `Fetch geometries (Ja)` group
  - Road centerline (Ja) (`fetchjaroad.py`): fetch road geometries from vector-tile map provided by the GSI of Japan
  - Buildings (Ja) (`fetchjabuilding.py`): fetch building geometries from vector-tile map provided by the GSI of Japan
  - Elevation points (Ja) (`fetchjadem.py`): fetch elevation-points geometries from vector-tile map provided by the GSI of Japan
  - Population (Ja) (`fetchjapop.py`): fetch 250m-mesh population from the ESTAT-API of Japan
  - Fetch geometries (Ja) (`fetchjageom.py`): fetch all geometries listed above (and also set receivers, if specified)

Note that `QuickOSM` plugin (https://docs.3liz.org/QuickOSM/) is needed to fetch geometries from OpenStreetMap.
To fetch geometries from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, user id and password of Earthdata Login (https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new) is needed.

### Set information on the sound sources

Before calculating sound levels, the user must set traffic volumes (light/medium/heavy vehicles during day/evening/night) or the sound power levels, as the fields of road layer.
Required fields are already set in the layer fetched if the features are fetched using the algorithms in `Fetch geometries` group (previous procedure).
Or, the user can manually set the fields using algorithms in `Initialize features` group.

The algorithms in `Initialize features` group are:

- Road with acoustic information (`initroad.py`): initialize linestrings as roads
- Road emission calculated from traffic (`initroademissionfromtraffic.py`): calculate the emission level (sound power level) using the traffic volume
- Building (`initbuilding.py`): initialize polygons as buildings
- Elevation point (`initelevationpoint.py`): initialize points as elevation points
- Ground absorption (`initgroundabsorption.py`): initialize polygons as ground absorption


### Set receiver points

To set receiver points, algorithms in `Set receivers` group are available.
The algorithms, employing `NoiseModelling` algorithms, set receiver points, such as at the facades of the buildings and at delaunay grid points.


The algorithms in `Set receiver` group are:

- At building facade (`receiverfacade.py`): create receivers at building facades
- Delaunay grid (`receiverdelaunaygrid.py`): create receivers at delaunay grid points
- Regular grid (`receiverregulargrid.py`): create receivers at regular grid points

### Calculate the sound levels

The sound levels at receiver points can be calculate using algorithms stored in `Predict sound level` group, employing `NoiseModelling`.

The algorithms in `Predict sound level` group are:

- Prediction from traffic (`noisefromtraffic.py`): calculate the sound levels from traffic volume
- Prediction from emission (`noisefromemission.py`): calculate the sound levels from the sound power level

### Estimate health risks

The user can assign the number of residents of each building and estimate health risks posed by the noise, using algorithms in `Evaluate health risk` group.

The algorithms in `Evaluate health risk` group are:

- Estimate populations of buildings using Raster (`estimatepopulationofbuilding.py`): estimate the number of residents for each building using a raster representing the population
- Estimate populations of buildings using Polygon (`estimatepopulationofbuildingplg.py`): estimate the number of residents for each building using polygons representing the population
- Estimate level of buildings (`estimatelevelofbuilding.py`): estimate the sound level for each building
